The subsequent code addresses the functionalities of the Ranking Model and the Evaluation-wise Layer.

Within each segment, a neural network has been instantiated utilizing the Fashion MNIST dataset. Specifically, the networks employ ResNet18 and EfficientNetB0 architectures.

For the layer preceding the classifier, five distinct geometric branches have been computed: Center-Based, High Order Soft SI (2), High Order SI (2), First Order SI, and SI Anti (2).

Let's elucidate on the principal components:

Ranking Model: This model is typically employed to rank instances or items based on predefined features or criteria. It often utilizes neural networks to learn item representations and subsequently rank them accordingly.

Evaluation-wise Layer: This term denotes the presence of a dedicated layer within the neural network architecture designed specifically for evaluation purposes. This layer is likely responsible for computing metrics or scores used to assess the model's performance.

Fashion MNIST Dataset: Comprising grayscale images of fashion items like clothing, shoes, and bags, the Fashion MNIST dataset serves as a standard benchmark for testing machine learning algorithms, particularly in the realm of computer vision tasks.

Neural Network Architectures: ResNet18 and EfficientNetB0 are prominent convolutional neural network architectures utilized for image classification tasks. ResNet18, a variant of the ResNet architecture, is distinguished by its residual connections, while EfficientNetB0, part of the EfficientNet family, is renowned for achieving state-of-the-art performance with efficient model sizes.

Geometric Branches: These branches likely represent diverse methodologies or approaches employed for feature extraction or transformation within the neural network. Each branch computes specific geometric properties or transformations of the input data, facilitating further processing or classification.

Center-Based: This branch presumably involves computing the center or centroid of the feature space to serve as a reference point for classification or clustering.

High Order Soft SI (2): This branch likely entails computing higher-order statistics or moments of the input features, potentially employing soft thresholding techniques for regularization.

High Order SI (2): Similar to the previous branch, this one may focus on higher-order statistics, possibly employing different techniques or approaches for calculation and regularization.

First Order SI: This branch likely deals with first-order statistics or moments of the input features, such as mean and variance.

SI Anti (2): This branch may involve some form of anti-symmetric transformation or operation applied to the input features, potentially enhancing discriminative information or reducing redundancy.

In summary, these components collectively signify a comprehensive approach to constructing and evaluating neural network models tailored to the Fashion MNIST dataset, incorporating diverse architectures and techniques for feature extraction and classification.
